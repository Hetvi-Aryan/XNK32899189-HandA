<p align="center">
    Do you zone out in the middle of your video call? Or are you super productive and want to multitask by attending call <b>and</b> doing something else? Then Meet-Mate aims to solve this issue by providing a watch for you (i.e. the text you specify) on Google Meet! This extension is built using **JavaScript** and **HTML** parses the captions of the call and alerts whenever someone says your defined string. It auto genertaes the meeting notes which you can download as pdf.
